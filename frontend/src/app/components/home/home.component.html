    <p>Hi there! Welcome to Codecraft. Codecraft is an educational website intended to help students improve and develop their coding skills and learn various topics
      related to computer science. We felt, the old codecraft was too limited in content and features. Also scalability was an issue due to technology barriers. Solving the above problems
      we launch this site with robust technology, and new features to improve your learning experience.

      <p>The site is built completly on the MEAN stack applying the MVC architecture. The acronym stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS.
      The complete stack is based on only one launguage, Javascript. MongoDB, a NoSql database has been used to store the entire content of the site. Angular is a front-end javascript based framework used to create single page dynamic websites.
      NodeJs, a javascript runtime has been used for writing the backend logic and routes. Express is the node web-applicaion framework used to configure the server.

        We have integrated the videogular HTML5 player for angular 2. It can be easily implemented in any angular project and has been configured
        to your needs. We loved the player for its decent looks and the variety of options it provided. We have ensured that you get all the controls you need while watching videos.
        Hope you have a great experience with this player.
